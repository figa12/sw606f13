\todo{This Chapter describes the Android platform, and which functionality of the Android platform that we have used.}
\section{Listview}

The menu for customisation in this project consists of three lists and it would thus be obvius to use the ListView class from the android library\autoref{androidlistview}. This proved to be quite the challenge, since the ListView is not optimised for manipulating it directly. This means that it is build for showing a data set in a list form, but if you want to change this data set on the fly, you run into a lot of problems. There are plenty of examples of people who struggle to use the ListView class\autoref{listviewfail}, and after a lot of wasted time, we chose to make our own class for listing data.
