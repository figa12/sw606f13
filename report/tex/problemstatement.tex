\section*{Project introduction}

Our focus in the multiproject is to create a game for the Android platform. 

We chose to use an exercise one of the pedagogues plays with the children, as an inspiration for our game. The purpose of the game is to create a dialogue between the child and the pedagogue. The child has to drag pictograms from a train station and onto the train wagons and make the train drive. When the train arrives at the next station, the child has to drag the correct pictograms from the train and onto the station. The correct pictograms are decided by the station category. 

The category for each station is chosen by the pedagogues by clicking the category picture frame and browse the pictogram database and choose the picture they want to use. After selecting a category they select which pictures they want associated with this station, these are the pictograms the kids have drag onto this specific station.
