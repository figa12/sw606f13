The \ac{giraf} project is a multi-project consisting of eight groups each with their own sub-project. The \ac{giraf} system is developed for the Android platform, and our focus is to develop a game.

The application is inspired by an exercise that our contact person, Tove SÃ¸by, practises with children with autism. The application makes use of drag and drop to drag pictograms to fulfil the games' criteria.

The application is split in two parts, the graphical part and a game customisation menu. The graphical part is developed using the \acl{opengles} graphics API.

The customisation menu allows for easy creation, saving, and deleting of customised games, each individual child can have unique customised games saved to their profile.
