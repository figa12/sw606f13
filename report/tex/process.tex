\todo{This Chapter describes the process of developing our game. At the end of each week, we wrote down what we had done and what choices we had made.}

\section*{Week 1 - 18/02/2013 - 22/02/2013}

After forming our groups we spent the first week brainstorming for ideas for a game. We had our first supervisor meeting this week as well, where we presented our initial idea and got some feedback, which we used as input. 

\section*{Week 2 - 18/02/2013 - 22/02/2013} 

We came up with the final theme and motivation for our game. We decided to focus on a learning exercise involving a train, which our contact person, Tove, used with the children. 

We arranged a meeting with Tove, so that we could present our idea and show her the paper prototype that we had made to demonstrate our idea. The feedback we received we have used throughout the project to design our game. 

Since this is a project that we are continuing from last year we had to set up Eclipse so that we could compile the old projects and run them on our tablet. 

After setting up Eclipse we spent the rest of the time experimenting with Android code and make small runnable programs. 

\section*{Week 3 - 25/02/2013 - 01/03/2013}

We are now able to drag and drop pictograms to different boxes. In case a box is already filled, then the dragged picture snaps back to its original box. In case you release the pictogram outside a box it will snap back to its original box. 

We also discussed how the layout of our game should be, in regards to where each pictogram box, train station, train etc. should be. 

We also looked into different methods to make our background slide to create the illusion that our train was moving between stations. 

\section*{Week 4 - 04/03/2013 - 08/03/2013}
We now had a sliding background which worked, however we discovered that it was too slow, so we instead had a discussing of whether or not we should use OpenGL. 

We also started making the graphics we needed for our game, using Adobe Illustrator.\todo{Kan man refere til design komiten?} We wanted to draw all the graphics in vector graphics so that we could easily scale it up or down without losing quality. 

We also had a short discussing regarding how to make it look like the train was moving. 

\section*{Week 5 - 11/03/2013 - 15/03/2013}
This week we finished Sprint 1, which focused on getting our application into the existing GIRAF launcher. We achieved this. 

We were also asked, by the Chief Integration Officer (\textbf{CIO} to make an ant script for our project so that he could set up continues integration for the multiproject. This was also achieved. 

We have decided to use OpenGL, since the alternative was way too slow. We use OpenGL to render our graphics. We are able to draw objects / pictures on the screen using OpenGL. 

We also created a little icon for our game. 

We had the second meeting with Tove this week as well, she gave some comments on our graphic and us some great ideas for improvement that we can use. She also suggested that there could be changing weather when the train moved from station to station. 

\section*{Week 6, 7, 8 and 9 - 18/03/2013-12/04/2013}
Since the last notes we have done a lot of "under the hood" work:

\begin{itemize}
\item We have decided to use OpenGL ES V1 instead of the newer V2. We chose to use V1 because it should be easier for OpenGL beginners. 
\item The class diagram (structure) for OpenGL drawing is implemented. It is now easy to draw and move objects across the screen. 
\item The wheels on the train and the smoke coming from the exhaust is now animated to create the illusion that the train is actually moving. 
\item The train can now smoothly accelerate and decelerate and can stop at exact coordinates in front of a station. 
\item "Garbage" has been improved, Garbage collection does almost not run any more. 
\item We have implemented the Pictogram class.
\item We sent an e-mail to Tove with some prototypes of how the game looks. She has replied with some improvement.
\end{itemize} 

\section*{Week 10, 11, 12 and 13 - 12/04/2013 - 10/05/2013}
Since the last notes we have almost finished the game, just need to fix a few bugs. Among the things we have implemented are:

\begin{itemize}
\item We now have hills in the background. They are made in sequences of four hills and are randomly picked throughout the game. 
\item We now have clouds and a sun on the sky. The clouds are moving at a random speed and at a random height on the sky. 
\item We now have cows and trees on the hills. These come at random times throughout the game.
\item We now have a train depot to indicate that the game has finished. 
\todo{Vi skal lige have skrevet alt p√• og have skrevet at vi har afsluttet hvert sprint.}
\end{itemize}
We also started writing on our report.
