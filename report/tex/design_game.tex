\subsection*{Game idea}
After some brainstorming and discussions with our supervisor we came up with an idea for our game, the game idea takes base in Tove's own exercise with the children. In one of the introduction weeks of this semester, Tove presented how she works with the children, improving their communication, categorization of objects, and social skills. In one of her exercises she try to improve the child's skill to categorize objects. This exercise consist of making the child take the right object, placing it on a train, and drive the train to the correct train station that accepts this object. This exercise has proven to Tove to be very powerful since it can be modified to help children categorize colors, sizes of objects, people of the child's social circle, and more. Though the exercise is good, the preparation time for each game can be very time consuming. She often has to make new pictograms or find objects of a certain requirement. Our game idea is to digitize the exercise and keep the principles of the exercises, by moving the exercise to a tablet we also hope that the preparation time for each child is reduced.
\subsection*{Game prototype}
When the game idea was agreed upon, we began developing and designing the interface. The interface should be simple and its main functionality of the interface should be to drag and drop pictograms on and off the train.
