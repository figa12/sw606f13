\section{Game Design}
In this section we will discuss and explain our thoughts about the game design, we will also comment on the feedback given by our contact person Tove Søby. Finally we will show the result of the game design.
\subsection{Game Idea/Description}\label{sec:gameidea}
%Skriv hvordan spillet fungere
In \chapref{processweek2} it is explained how Tove Søby's version of the exercise work. We intent to keep the same principles of Tove Søby's exercise. We will start by given a short description of the important objects of the game.
\begin{description}
\item[Pictogram] Is an object which contains a picture and is draggable.
\item[Train Station] Is a station where the train stops, and allows the child to drag and drop pictograms onto the station. Each station has a picture indicating the category of the station. The category of the station describes the pictograms that should be dropped onto the station.  

\item[Train whistle] Is a button that the child can press if they think that the correct pictograms have been dropped onto the station. If however the child have made a mistake and dropped a pictogram not belonging to the station's category, then the train will not start. The train whistle was added by Tove Søby's request.

\item[Train and wagons] The train is the vehicle that drives  to each station. The train has two wagons, each wagon can carry either two or three pictograms, depending on the total number of pictogram in the game.

\item[Landscape] Is a sequence of hills, trees, cows, and clouds. The landscape objects are placed in the background behind the stations.

\item[Train depot] When the train is driving from the last train station, the train will drive into the train depot to indicate the the game is over. The train depot was added by Tove Søby's request.
\end{description}
At the start of the game, the child must drag the pictograms off the start train station and drop them onto the train, the start station is different since it does not have a category. The start station is to help the child understand how to move the pictograms with drag and drop. When the child has moved all the pictures onto the train, it is allowed to drive towards the next station. Between the stations the train drives through a landscape sequence. The next train station has a category, which could be a picture of animals. It is now up to the child to drag all the animals off the train onto the station, before the train is allowed to continue. If all the right pictograms is on the station, the train will drive onto the next station. When all the pictograms is off the game will end.

\subsection{Game Prototype}

\end{figure}
\autoref{fig:paperprototype} shows the paper prototype we showed Tove Søby at our first meeting, in which we explained our game idea. She liked the game idea and the user interface. Although she would like to add a button that checks if the correct pictograms have been dragged off the train, if this is case the button should start the train. She also mentioned that the game should have an ending, she suggested that the train could drive into a train depot. To accommodate these two features we added the train whistle and train depot to the game. 
Lastly Tove Søby mentioned that the game should not contain many colors and sounds, since this would cause visual and audible noise for the child. 

\subsection{Final Game Design}\label{sec:designgameinterface}

During the project we sent screen shots of the game interface to Tove Søby, to confirm that we were on the right track. Mostly she did not have not much to add, only small graphical adjustments to stations.

In order to mimic Tove Søby's version of the exercise we had to make the game customizable, this was achieved by adding a menu where Tove Søby was able to customize the pictograms and the category for each station. The menu and its functionality is explained later in \secref{designmenu}.
During the design phase we agreed upon some constants of the game, the distance between the stations, the velocity of the train, etc. The constants in the game have all been approved of Tove Søby. The constants and their values are shown in \appref{app:constants}.
To prevent that the game is the same every time it is played, we decided to add random elements to the game, e.g. the order of stations, the placement of the hills, and the decorative objects(cows, trees, clouds). 
All the textures of the game can be viewed in the \appref{app:gametextures}

\autoref{fig:finalresult} and \autoref{fig:miniaturegame} shows the final result of the game design. \autoref{fig:finalresult} shows the starting station, note that the station is missing a category in the top section of the station. The pictograms have also yet to be dragged off the station.
\autoref{fig:miniaturegame} shows a full game, though the game is simple it contains all the necessary objects. It should be noted that the game shown is missing the landscape sequence and all the decorative objects.
